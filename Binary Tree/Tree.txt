What is tree?
= Tree is a nonlinear data structure with hierarchical relationships between
    its elements without having any cycle.

Tree Properties:
1. Represent hierarchical data
2. Each node has two components: data and a link to it's sub category
3. Base category and sub category under it

Why a Tree?
1. It is nonlinear data structure, so time complexity is also nonlinear.
2. Quicker and Easier access to data
3. Store hierarchical data, like folder structure, organization structure

Tree Terminology:
Root: top node without parent
Edge: link between parent and child
Leaf: a node which does not have children
Sibling: children of same parent
Ancestor: parent, grandparent, great grandparent of a node
Depth of node: a length of the path from root to node
Height of node: a length of the path from the node to the deepest node
Depth of tree: depth of root node
Height of tree: Height of root node
